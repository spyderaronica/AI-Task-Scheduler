# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

###Task Manager
###Description
Task Manager is a robust application that allows users to manage tasks effectively by leveraging FastAPI as the backend framework. It includes features like user authentication (signup and login), task prioritization powered by an AI model, and integration with Google Cloud services.

###Features
User Authentication:
Signup with email and password.
Login with JWT-based authentication.
Task Management:
Create, update, and delete tasks.
AI-powered task prioritization based on task descriptions.
AI Integration:
A trained AI model predicts task priorities (e.g., High, Medium, Low).
Google Cloud Integration:
Uses Google Pub/Sub for notifications and task reminders.

###Technologies Used
Backend:
FastAPI: Python-based web framework.
SQLAlchemy: ORM for database management.
Pydantic: Data validation.
Database:
PostgreSQL: Relational database for storing user and task data.
Authentication:
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): Secure authentication mechanism.
AI:
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for training the task prioritization model.
Cloud:
Google Cloud Pub/Sub: For handling notifications.
DevOps:
Uvicorn: ASGI server for running FastAPI.

###Setup Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/task-manager.git
cd task-manager
2. Create a Virtual Environment
bash
Copy code
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
3. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Set Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following:

plaintext
Copy code
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_key
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost/taskmanager
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/path/to/your/google-credentials.json
5. Run Database Migrations
bash
Copy code
alembic upgrade head
6. Train the AI Model (Optional)
If the task prioritization model is not already trained:

bash
Copy code
python app/data/train_model.py
7. Start the Application
